# Code_Refactor
## Homework 01

## Description
Refactor the given index and style sheets so that future devs can more easily understand and change, themselves. 

## Changes
Majority of changes I made were in the style sheets. I consolidated and grouped a lot of the data. I also made classes and changed tags in the index to give more information on what those tags were doing. 


WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
HTML elements were changed and classes were created to make more semantic.

WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
White space and comments were added to make the structure more logical and readable.

WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
Alt attributes were added.

WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
All attributes fell into an order that made most sense to me. 

WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
I gave the title Horiseon to be concise and descriptive.
